Used ML methods -NaiveBayes-SVM-Ensemble-Methods-Co-Training

This is a research project wherein we are evaluating different classifiers on the same test data.

Classifiers evaluated: Naive Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks

Classifiers we are planning to use: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees 

Classification Methods we are planning to use: Ensemble methods Co-Training Classifiers using scikit learn library

Results obtained: Accuracy of NB classifier: 56.06%
