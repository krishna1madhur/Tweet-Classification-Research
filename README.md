# Tweet-Classification-Research

This is a research project wherein I evaluated different classifiers and different classification techniques to develop a classifier for the given training data. 

Used Supervised Classification Techniques like Naive bayes, SVM, Logistic Regresssion, Neural Netwroks, KNN etc; for multi-class text classification. 

Performed the tests using 10-Fold cross validation on training data to improve the classifier. Finally performed the tweet classification on test data without the use of it.

Classification Techniques Used for improving F Score: Stratified K Fold, Ensemble methods, Over Sampling and Under Sampling

Instructions to run the programs:

1. Download python3, Numpy, Scipy, nltk libraries.(Ubuntu is recommended)
2. Place the training dataset and the python files in the same folder if you are running the Classifiers on KFold.
3. Place training dataset, testing dataset and python files in the same folder if you are running the Classifiers on Test Data.
4. Run the programs to obtain the results.
